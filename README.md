# house_price_prediction using Linear Regression

LINEAR REGRESSION:


 Linear Regression is a supervised machine learning model that attempts to model a linear relationship between dependent variables (Y)  and independent variables (X).  Every evaluated observation with a model, the target (Y)’s actual value is compared to the target (Y)’s predicted value, and the major differences in these values are called residuals. The Linear Regression model aims to minimize the sum of all squared residuals.

Now let’s consider every step for the house price prediction using linear regression. 
Consider a company of real estate with datasets containing the property prices of a specific region. The price of a property is based on essential factors like bedrooms, areas, and parking.  Majorly, a real estate company requires:

Find the variable that affects the price of a house.
Creating a linear model quantitatively related to the house price with variables like areas, number of rooms and bathroom, etc.
For finding the accuracy of a model, that means how well the variables can predict the prices of a house.
